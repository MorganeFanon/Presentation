## _Currently studying Web Development at Becode_

Hi there, my name is Morgane ! I'm a belgian coming from a small village in the province of Liège. I've been living in Brussels for 11 years now.  just started studying coding at Becode. I'm a creative person whose passions are watching great classics  of cinema, music , taking pictures, and reading.

## 3 most surprising skills about me:
- I play the piano 
- I can cook very good "boulets à liégeoise"
- I can speak Dutch, English and French

## 3 things I like the most in this universe: 
- chilling with my friends 
- riding my bike 
- discovering new places and countries

## The ojectives I want to achieve as a developer during Becode
I would like to do my best and test my limits. I think Becode is a great environment to learn about yourself and I hope to discover new skills,  including those related to teamwork and helping others. 

## The fears I might have
 I'm a bit apprehensive about the internship talking place at the end of the training. I hope I'll be at a good level by then. I think these 7 months will pass very quickly so I hope to give it my all during this period. 

## The things I look forward to
I hope that at the end of this training I will have created a professional network that will help me to start my professional career as a Web Developer. 

## 3 things I value the most to work as a team
The creativity that emerges from it. 
The power of the teamwork

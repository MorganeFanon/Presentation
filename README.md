## _Currently studying Web Development at Becode_

Hi there, my name is Morgane ! I'm a belgian coming from a small village in South of Belgium. I've been living in Brussels for 11 years now. I've now been at BeCode for 7 months and I love it !!!
I'm a creative person who's always happy to learn new skills.

## 3 most surprising skills about me:
- I play the piano 🎹
- I can cook very good "boulets à liégeoise". A great culinary specialty of my region! 🍴
- French is my mothertongue but I can also speak Dutch 🚲 and  English 🎩. I'm also currently learning Italian 🍝

## 3 things I like the most in this universe: 
- chilling with my friends 🍸
- riding my bike 🚲, running 🏃 and practicing yoga 🙆‍♀️
- discovering new places and countries 🌅

## The ojectives I want to achieve as a developer during Becode
I would like to do my best and test my limits. I think Becode is a great environment to learn about yourself and I hope to discover new skills,  including those related to teamwork and helping others. 

## The fears I might have
 I'm a bit apprehensive about the internship talking place at the end of the training. I hope I'll be at a good level by then. I think these 7 months will pass very quickly so I hope to give it my all during this period. 

## The things I look forward to
I hope that at the end of this training I will have created a professional network that will help me to start my professional career as a Web Developer. 

## 3 things I value the most to work as a team
The creativity that emerges from it. 
The power of the teamwork
>Alone we go faster, together we go further
